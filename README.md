# WebScraping-ao3
I'm currently involved in a project related to providing fandom creatives a new platform where they can truly develop their craft.
	To do this, contacting said creatives is essential. We decided to scrape users' public emails from their profiles.
	The profiles picked out were chosen based on their presence in the "recent" section of Archive of Our Own pages.

Other relevant information to be scraped will be:
  - tags of the work they publish ( a.k.a fandoms they're involved with) - both characters and ships
  - Their date of birth (for now, it's only a possibility but the app to be advertised for *is* GenZ centric)

Data is stored in csv file.
